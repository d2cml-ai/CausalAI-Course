The article aim to use the teory of hedonic prices using techniques of deep learning to estimate the price index of some product. Also they compare these hedonic prices with other price index like Laspeyres, Paasche and Fisher. For this purpous ther use data from Amazon, for the products and also to manage the high dimmensionality data they use Amazaon Web Service(AWS) and Spark, which is an open source package to manage big data.
    
    
Somo of the important feature of the reasearch is the use of novel techniques as Neural networks. The Artificial Intelligence is one of the most onteresting fields these days and the fact that the author propose to estimate hedonic prices with new technique are a real improve in the field of index prices. Related with the strength of the article there are some issues with the neural networks. These kind of method are part of the deep learning field. Some data scientist says that these algorithm behave as a black box because the inner process is not well known. Even if the estimation can be accurate or near of the target some countries has some rules of the implements of these kind of algorithms in the decision making moment. In these case is just an academic research so these issue doesnt affect but the behave as a black box is still present for some data scientist.


As the authors mentioned, there is not some articles releted to the index prices topic using deep learning techniques like neural networks. In my opinion is the main reason why these article is so relevant nowadays. Also the use of all these kind of tchniques related to the high dimensionality of data as Spark, Amazon Web Services and environments are part of the Big Data Framework that are present in many funtionalities every day. 


The next step in the path of the research could be to analyze other markets or other countries. These could help to compare the behave of the differernts markets and the effects of the change in the index prices.
