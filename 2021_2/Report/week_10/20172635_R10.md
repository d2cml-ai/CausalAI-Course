In the paper, the authors will develop empirical models of hedonic prices and will derive indices to measure changes in customer well-being. To do this, they will follow a series of steps: the first is to generate characteristics based on text and image descriptions and this with neural networks, later, the hedonic price function will be estimated. What is interesting about this document, at their own discretion, is how the authors transform the textual or visual information (images) of the products into numerical information using languages such as ELMO or BERT.

The authors develop the article in a field of interest to us, economics. In this, the Laspeyeres, Paasch and Fisher indices are well known; However, little has been heard regarding hedonic indices, which address the problem of product entry and exit, hence the underlying reason that the difference between the prices of newer and older products is not attributed to inflation completely. In this sense, a different way of calculating this arises and it is related to a consumer theory about the characteristics of the product. This would tell us that the prices of the products will be determined by their characteristics.

In this sense, the general contribution of the text is the generation of attributes or characteristics using state-of-the-art deep learning models to later estimate hedonic prices. Specifically, the main contribution is the conversion of the text of the product into numerical characteristics through ELMO or EBERT, and which I consider the most interesting and important part of the document.

I consider that one of the advantages of the approach used is the empirical application on Amazon data, since by means of this approach it can show the results obtained where the prediction obtained is high, since it is between 80 and 90%. The author points out that this performance may be due to the fact that the production of hedonic prices is automatic, scalable and the extractions of characteristics are not based on humans, so that possible bias in between is eliminated. Then these hedonic prices suggest a good first-order approximation to prices.
Regarding the next steps, the author mentions that he has not found works that have developed hedonic price models, so it would be very useful to expand the research using other data sources or in other countries.

Finally, I would like to point out that I have found this document as one of the most interesting, as it is closely linked to economics and I consider it very important to continue delving into this topic, which is "new" because although there is a theory about it, empirical applications are very few.
