    "The objetive of this paper is to evaluate the impact of a nudge-like intervention designed to instill students with a growth mindset on student achievement using simulated data from a model fit from the National Study of Learning Mindsets. This paper aims to answer three questions:\n",
    " * Was the mindset intervention efective in improving student achievement?\n",
    " * Was the efect of the intervention moderated by school level achievement ($X_2$) or pre-existing mindset norms ($X_1$)?\n",
    " * Do other covariates moderate treatment efects?\n",
    " \n",
    "However, there are 2 methodological challenges to take into account. First, althought is a randomized study, there seems to be some selection efects in the synthetic data. Because of this, the study will be analyzed as an observational rather than randomized study. Second, the students in this study all drawn from 76 randomly selected schools,thus, were not independently sampled. Since there seems to be considerable heterogeneity across schools because of this, we need make an analysis that robustly accounts for the sampling variability of potentially unexplained school-level in order to generalize outside our sample. \n",

The squared difference (out-of-bag predicitions and real observations) between them is the RSE.

The best linear predictor analysis tries to fit the CATE found as a function of the out-of-bag causal forest estimates. In this regression they fit $Y_i - \\hat{m}^{-i}(X_i)$ with $D_i= (\\hat{\\tau}^{-i}(X_i)-\\overline{\\tau})(W_i-\\hat{e}^{-i}(X_i))$ and $C_i=\\tau (W_i-\\hat{e}^{-i}(X_i))$.

If the coefficient on $D_i$ , related to CATE, it means the heteregenooius estimates are well calibrated, however, we only need it to be positive and significant to have evidence that we can't not deny correlation between the CATE and the real effect of the treatment.

We find that the distribution of the ATE seems to hold higher values than when considering clustering, but at the same time the distribution is more disperse since now is between 0.0 a 0.6 (almost the triple size of the range!). However, as hold before, this a naive approach since it ignores the possible correlations of the student's errors that attend the same school."

As we can see, there seem to be a negative relation between the value of this variable and the CATE found. This explains us why is the best predictor of the measure of achievement $Y$. Nonetheless, as seen before, there's no enough evidence that this variable, when controled by other ones, is enough to prove heterogenity between the effects."
