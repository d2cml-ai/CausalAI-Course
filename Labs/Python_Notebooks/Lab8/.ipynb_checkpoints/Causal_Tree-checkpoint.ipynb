    "The Bonferroni and Romano-Wolf methods control the **familywise error rate (FWER)**, which is the (asymptotic) probability of rejecting even one true null hypothesis. In other words, for a significance level $\\alpha$, they guarantee that with probability $1 - \\alpha$ we will make zero false discoveries. However, when the number of hypotheses being tested is very large, this criterion may be so stringent that it prevents us from being able to detect real effects. Instead, there exist alternative procedures that control the (asymptotic) **false discovery rate (FDR)**, defined as the expected proportion of true null hypotheses rejected among all hypotheses rejected. One such procedure is the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, which is available in base R via `p.adjust(..., method=\"BH\")`. For what remains we'll stick with FWER control, but keep in mind that FDR control can also useful in exploratory analyses or settings in which there's a very large number of hypotheses under consideration.\n",
